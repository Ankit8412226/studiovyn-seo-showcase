    body: `Building a high-performing website is the foundation for local SEO success in Bihar.\n\nTo rank in Patna, Gaya, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, and beyond, businesses need fast pages, clean architecture, and content that addresses local search intent. Start with Core Web Vitals—optimize Largest Contentful Paint with proper image sizes and caching. Keep CLS low by reserving space for images and fonts.\n\nNext, implement LocalBusiness schema and ensure consistent Name-Address-Phone (NAP) data across directories. Claim and optimize your Google Business Profile with accurate categories, photos, and regular posts. Encourage reviews and respond to them to build trust signals.\n\nCreate city-specific landing pages targeting services + city terms, such as “web development in Patna”. Each page should include relevant case studies, testimonials, and a clear call-to-action.\n\nFinally, track rankings and conversions. Use Search Console for queries and PageSpeed Insights for performance. Iteration is key—improve content based on user behavior and analytics.`,

Use breadcrumb schema and FAQs to enhance visibility.\n\nMeasure success with Core Web Vitals and conversion tracking. Small wins compound into higher rankings and revenue.`,
